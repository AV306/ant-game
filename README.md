# ant-game

Hello! This is a repository for a random game about killing ants I thought of while in a lucid dream.

There are too many ants in my home.

Have fun!

Dedicated to Nicholas and Austin.

## Features (ALL SUBJECT TO CHANGE)

### Ants

The main "enemies".

Two variants: big and small.

#### Big

- 4 health default (doubles every wave)
- 0.5x movement speed default
- 2x size
- 20pts for killing (doubles every 2 waves)
- Worth 2 small ants in counter
- Changes direction every 5s

#### Small

- 2 health default (doubles every wave)
- 1x movement speed default (1.5x every wave)
- 1x size
- 10pts for killing (doubles every 2 waves)
- Changes direction every 2s

### Spiders???

ohno spiders \:O

#### Jumping

GODDAMN IT I HATE JUMPING SPIDERS

#### Big

KILL IT WITH FIRE (flamethrower???)

#### Normal

- Will help kill ants???
- -15 pts for killing :(

### Weapons \:D // TODO: Needs testing, likely going to be nerfed

- hand (-2hp) (default)
- rolled-up newspaper (-4hp) (500pts)
- bagett (-16hp) (1,000pts)
- class 1 insectiside (-16hp, continuous up to 4s then 2s cooldown) (2,000pts)
- electric swatter (-64hp) (5,000pts)
- flamethrower (-128hp, overheating-style 4s cooldown) (10,000pts)
- screen-clearing grenade (instant clear, one-time use) (one every two waves)

### Game Logic

- 4:1 ratio of big to small 
- Total ants doubles every 2 waves, starts at 10
- Game continues till 5 ants reach the "goal", counter resets and max increases by 3 every 2 waves
